0. Introduction

gensplash is based on Genkernel code and that's why it's Gentoo-specific.  It
requires splashutils to work.  To set up theme you may edit /etc/conf.d/splash
or set DRACUT_GENSPLASH_THEME and DRACUT_GENSPLASH_RES variables.  Your theme
has to exist in /etc/splash and for every given resolution has to exist config
in theme's directory, e.g. there's 1024x768.cfg in /etc/splash/natural_gentoo.
List of resolutions is comma-separated.

NOTE: The module will be rewritten to be distro-neutral. Its name will change
to fbsplash.


1. Hostonly vs Generic

All available themes are installed only if no --hostonly is specified and no
DRACUT_GENSPLASH_THEME and DRACUT_GENSPLASH_RES are set.  Otherwise those vars
are checked and if not set then config /etc/conf.d/splash is read.


2. Configuration and kernel parameters

Example set up by environment variables:
    DRACUT_GENSPLASH_THEME=natural_gentoo
    DRACUT_GENSPLASH_RES=1024x768,1024x600

Example kernel arguments:
    splash=silent,theme:natural_gentoo console=tty1 quiet

You may easily set up the module using Genkernel with arguments:
    --gensplash=<theme>:<res1>,<res2>,...
